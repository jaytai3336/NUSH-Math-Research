# NUS High Mathematical Research Projects

This repository contains a collection of mathematical research projects conducted during my time at NUS High School of Math and Science, focused on inequalities, trigonometric polynomials, and analytic techniques.

## 📘 Projects

### 1. Brannan’s Conjecture and Trigonometric Polynomials
- **Summary:** Investigates functional upper bounds related to Brannan’s conjecture, with applications to trigonometric series and complex analysis. The paper submitted for SSEF only covers the case when r=1 while the paper submitted for ISSF covers the cases: r=1 and 1/2<r<1.
- **Recognition:**
  - 🥈 *Merit Award*, Singapore Science and Engineering Fair (SSEF) 2021
  - 🏅 *Research Excellence Award*, International Student Science Fair (ISSF) 2021
- **Files:** `SSEF_paper.pdf`, `SSEF_poster.pdf`, `ISSF_paper.pdf`, `ISSF_slides.pdf` (slides have some formatting issues)

### 2. Some Functional Upper Bounds for Fejér’s Sine Polynomial
- **Summary:** Published paper providing novel upper bounds for Fejér-type trigonometric polynomials, contributing to the understanding of harmonic analysis and inequalities.
- **Published in:** *Studia Scientiarum Mathematicarum Hungarica*, Vol. 58, pp. 358–366, Sept 2021

### 3. A Sharp Trigonometric Double Inequality
- **Summary:** Published paper establishing a sharp double inequality involving trigonometric functions, improving classical bounds and contributing to the theory of trigonometric approximations and inequalities.
- **Published in:** *Publicationes Mathematicae Debrecen*, Vol. 98(1–2), pp. 231–242, Jan 2021

## 🧠 Background

These projects were developed under the mentorship of Dr Tuo Yeong Lee (retired) as part of NUS High School’s Research Program. They involved intensive use of trigonometric identities, inequalities, symbolic computation, and mathematical writing in LaTeX.
